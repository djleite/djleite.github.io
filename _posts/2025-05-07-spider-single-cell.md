## Background

Arthopods are and extremely diverse groupd of animals. Spiders represent an early branch of arthopods called chelicerates. Understanding the genetics mechanisms of developmental process in these animals, and comparing them to other arthropods has helped to reveal how arthopod development has evolved.....
