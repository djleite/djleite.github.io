## Background
Lophotrochozoans are a diverse group of organisms that display a variety of interesting and unique developmental processes. To understand the genetic basis of these process, genomes provide an incredibly valuable resource. They make gene annotation easier compared to transcriptome-only methods, and give crucial information about copy number and synteny. We were particularly interested in comparing spiral cleavage and larval development in the polyclad flatworm  Prostheceraeus crozieri to other lophotrochozoans. We went out to collect animals for sequencing and downstream embryological studies.

## Animal collection
Our adventure started in the Florida Keys, at the [Keys Marine Lab](https://www.fio.usf.edu/keys-marine-lab/). Renting kayaks, we surveyed the local mangroves, looking for the ascidians, where the flatworms congregated.

The flatworms were collected into large salt-water tanks (fig 2). Within a few days, they were already laying hundreds of fertilised eggs. They were kept here before transportation back to the UK.

## Sequencing and assembly
For genome sequencing and assembly, high molecular weight DNA was extracted from one animal and sequenced using long-read PacBio (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/14/9/evac133/6678951" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leite <i>et al</i> 2022</a>). These long-reads were assembled, resulting in a 2.07 gigabase (Gb) assembly. Notably, the genome was highly repetitive, with repetitive elements constituting approximately 67.9%. A total of 43,325 genes were annotated, and had a Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) completeness score of 89.7%, indicating a relatively high-quality assembly compared with other flatworms. Furthermore, compared to other free-living flatworms, <i>P. crozieri</i> exhibits considerably larger introns. The abundance of transposable elements and repetitive sequences likely contributes to the expanded genome size and intron length.

## Key findings
The <i>P. crozieri</i> genome now provides a valuable resource for studying the evolution and development of flatworms. Given that polyclads are among the few flatworm classes retaining canonical spiralian development and ciliated larvae comparable to trochophore larvae in annelids and molluscs, this genome assembly offers insights into ancestral developmental features and facilitates comparative studies across the animal kingdom.
