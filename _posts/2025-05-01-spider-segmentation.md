excerpt: The genetic mechanisms that control spider posterior segmentation during development

## Background
Arthropods exhibit morphologically segmented bodies, and this segmentation originates from underlying genetic patterning during embryonic development. In some species, such as the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, segmentation follows a long-germ mode, where gene expression cascades simultaneously establish all segments along the antero-posterior axis. In contrast, spiders undergo short-germ segmentation, in which posterior segments are added sequentially after the initial formation of anterior segments. Despite these differences in developmental strategy, the genetic components involved in segmentation are often conserved across diverse arthropod lineages. By studying <i>Parasteatoda tepidariorum</i> and analysing gene expression patterns during embryogenesis, we have uncovered specific genetic dynamics underlying spider segmentation. Focusing on the roles of the Wnt and Delta-Notch signalling pathways, their downstream target, as well as the transcription factor *Sox21b-1*, our findings revealed a complex interplay between these components, orchestrating the formation of both anterior and posterior body segments.

## Key findings

### Wnt and Delta-Notch Signalling in Segmentation
We investigated how posterior segments are added sequentially from the segment addition zone (SAZ) during embryogenesis (<a href="https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/143/13/2455/47399/The-Wnt-and-Delta-Notch-signalling-pathways" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schönauer <i>et al</i> 2016</a>). Specifically, we observed that Wnt8 and Delta-Notch signalling exhibit oscillatory expression patterns in the SAZ, coordinating the timing of segment addition. Disruption of either pathway leads to aberrant expression of downstream gap and pair-rule genes <i>caudal</i>, <i>even-skipped</i> and <i>runt</i>  resulting in defective posterior segmentation.

### Sox21b-1: A Dual Role in Segmentation
We also examined the function of the SoxB gene <i>Sox21b-1</i> in spider segmentation (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paese <i>et al</i> 2018</a>). Our findings demonstrate that <i>Sox21b-1</i> serves dual roles in both anterior and posterior segmentation. In the anterior, <i>Sox21b-1</i> acts as a gap gene, essential for the formation of the leg-bearing prosomal segments (L1–L4). Knockdown experiments resulted in the loss of these segments, highlighting its critical role in anterior development. In the posterior, <i>Sox21b-1</i> is necessary for the establishment of the SAZ and subsequent addition of opisthosomal segments. It functions upstream of both Wnt8 and Delta-Notch signalling pathways, regulating their expression and, consequently, maintenance of the SAZ. Furthermore, <i>Sox21b-1</i> influences the expression of other key genes involved in germ layer specification, such as <i>forkhead</i> , indicating its broader role in embryonic development.

### Identifying new segmentation genes with scRNAseq
We used [single-cell sequencing of spider embryos](/spider-single-cell) to find new genes that regulate different aspects of posterior segmentation (<a href="https://evodevojournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13227-024-00224-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leite <i>et al</i> 2024</a>). Markers from several cell clusters showed expression in specific regions of the segmenting embryos (fig 1). These included genes (<i>AP2</i>, <i>g30822</i>) that were similarly restricted to the very posterior, like <i>Wnt8</i>; genes that showed striped expression, in different phases like <i>DSPP</i> and <i>RNF220</i>; and also a newly characterised region of <i>notum</i> expression, anterior to <i>Wnt8</i> expression, where segmentation matures along with <i>engrailed</i>.

## Impact
Our studies reveal both conserved and divergent players in the gene regulatory networks governing spider segmentation (fig 2). The interplay between <i>Wnt8</i>, Delta-Notch signalling, and <i>Sox21b-1</i> ensures the coordinated formation of body segments during development. These findings not only enhance our understanding of arachnid embryogenesis but also provide insights into the evolutionary conservation and diversification of segmentation mechanisms across arthropods.
