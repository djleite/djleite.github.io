excerpt: The genetic mechanisms that control spider posterior segmentation during development

## Background

Under construction

Arthopods bodies are segmented. This process of dividing body regions into morphological segments starts as genetic segmentation during development. For some species, like the fruit-fly <i>Drosophila</i>, long-germ segmenation occurs where the cascades of gene expression resolve all segments across the antero-posterior axis. In contrast, spiders display short-germ segmentation, whereby posterior segments are added sequentially. Interestingly, dispite these different segmentation mechanisms, the genetic components are often found to be similar across different arthropod species. Using Parasteatoda tepidariorum and embryonic expression analyses we have been able to reveal particular genetic dynamics in spider segmentation.
