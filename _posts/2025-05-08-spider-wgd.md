excerpt: Impact of genome evolution in chelicerate lineages with whole genome duplication
---

## Background

Whole genome duplication (WGD) contributes large additions of genetic material that impacts genome evolution. The evolution of additional coding and non-coding elements can alter the regulation of developmental processes, resulting in phenotypic change and diversification. Analyses of genomic and transcriptomic data has revealed that the arthropod subphylum of Chelicerata contains multiple WGDs. This includes a single WGD in the ancestor of arachnopulmonates (spiders, scorpions, and their relatives), and independently three WGDs in the lineage of horseshoe crabs (fig 1).

## Genomes of spiders and scorpions
Our analysis of some of the first spider and scorpion genomes ([Schwager <i>et al</i> 2017](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-017-0399-x)) revealed evidence of WGD. The evidence included elevated duplication levels of BUSCO genes, duplication of many developmental genes (e.g. [homeobox genes](/_posts/spider-wgd#homeobox-genes) and [Sox genes](_posts/spider-wgd#sox-genes)), conservation of synteny between genomic scaffolds and gene clusters, and phylogenetics signatures from gene tree topologies.

## Homeobox genes
One of the hallmarks of WGD in animal lineages are the presence of duplcate Hox clusters. In the <i>P. tepidariorum</i> and <i>C. sculpturatus</i> genomes, we identified almost intact duplicate Hox clusters.

I surveyed genomic and transcriptomic resources across arthropods to systematically survey homeobox gene duplication ([Leite <i>et al</i> 2018](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/35/9/2240/5040134)). This analysis captured a clear signal that approximately 50% of homeobox gene families were duplicated in arachnopulmonates, with conservation of duplication across arachnopulmonate species.

This survey of homeobox genes duplication has been extended as genomic resources improved in contiguity and diversity ([Aase-Remedios <i>et al</i> 2023](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/40/12/msad239/7341927)). Given the improvement of contiguity we have been able to contextualise the syntenic relationships of homeobox clusters, and how their rearrangements between species coincide with genomic shuffling (fig 3).
