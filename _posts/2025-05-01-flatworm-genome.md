excerpt: Sequencing of the polyclad flatworm genome

Our adventure started in the Florida Keys, at the [Keys Marine Lab](https://www.fio.usf.edu/keys-marine-lab/). Renting kayaks, we surveyed the local mangroves, looking for the ascidians, were the flatworms congregated.

The article titled "Genome Assembly of the Polyclad Flatworm Prostheceraeus crozieri" by Leite et al., published in Genome Biology and Evolution (2022), presents the first high-quality genome assembly for P. crozieri, a representative of Polycladidaâ€”a group of marine flatworms considered basal within Platyhelminthes. This genome provides valuable insights into the evolution and development of flatworms, particularly concerning features like spiral cleavage and larval diversification.

ðŸ§¬ Key Findings
Genome Assembly and Size:

Utilizing high molecular weight DNA extraction and long-read PacBio sequencing, the researchers assembled the P. crozieri genome, which spans approximately 2.07 gigabases (Gb).

The genome is notably repetitive, with repetitive elements constituting about 67.9% of its content.

Gene Annotation and Completeness:

A total of 43,325 genes were annotated within the genome.

Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis indicated a completeness score of 89.7%, suggesting a high-quality assembly with most expected genes present.

Genomic Features:

Compared to other free-living flatworms, P. crozieri exhibits considerably larger introns.

The abundance of transposable elements and repetitive sequences likely contributes to the expanded genome size and intron length.

ðŸ”¬ Methodology
Sample Preparation:

High molecular weight DNA was extracted from P. crozieri specimens to ensure the quality necessary for long-read sequencing.

Sequencing and Assembly:

The genome was sequenced using PacBio long-read technology, which is adept at resolving repetitive regions and complex genomic structures.

Assembly algorithms were employed to construct the genome from the sequencing data, resulting in a contiguous and comprehensive genome assembly.

Gene Annotation:

Gene prediction tools were used to identify and annotate protein-coding genes within the assembled genome.

Functional annotations were assigned based on sequence similarity to known genes and protein domains.

ðŸ§  Evolutionary Implications
The availability of the P. crozieri genome offers a valuable resource for comparative genomic studies among flatworms and other spiralian lineages. Given its basal position within Platyhelminthes, P. crozieri serves as a crucial model for understanding the ancestral genomic features and developmental processes of flatworms. The high repeat content and large intron sizes observed may reflect unique evolutionary pressures or life history traits specific to polyclads.
