## Background

Lophotrochozoans are a diverse group of organisms that display a variety of interesting and unique developmental processes. To understand the genetic basis of these process, genomes provide an incredibly valuable resource. They make gene annotation easier compared to transcriptome-only methods, and give crucial information about copy number and synteny.

interested in lophotrochozoans spiral clevage and larval development and need a genome of a polyclad flatworm, as they display interesting differences compared to other animals like snails and oysters

## Animal collection

Our adventure started in the Florida Keys, at the [Keys Marine Lab](https://www.fio.usf.edu/keys-marine-lab/). Renting kayaks, we surveyed the local mangroves, looking for the ascidians, were the flatworms congregated.

The flatworms were collected into large salt-water tanks.
