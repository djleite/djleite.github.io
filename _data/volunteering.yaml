  text: Today we pruned the aromatic shrubs, since none of them were flowering. Before starting, we had to clean all the pruning tools. The sap left on the tools can carry viruses and bacteria, which can infect plants by entering pruning cuts. We then assessed the plants and key aspects to consider for each pruning method, such as shearing, dead wood removal, pruning to the base, or just by a few nodes. All trimmings were collected and bagged, paths swept, to make the garden look fresh and well maintained.

  text: The heat has taken a toll on the plants and they are in need of watering. The Physic Garden, lower tier by the fountain and the raised beds by the café all had a good soaking, as well as other parts of the park. Care was taken to not splash the leaves and cause scorching, since the sun was out shining.

  text: Young hazelnut trees, some of which had been copiced, are surrounded by other trees and bramble. The plants covering the floor and bramble have grown extensively over the past year. This is potentially inhibiting the growth of the hazelnuts and wild flowers, which were since growing in the area last year. An area around the hazelnuts was therefore cleared, giving more space and light, hopefully allowing for the return of these wild flowers.
