  text: We spent the morning clearing and tidying the Prairie beds. While we removed a lot of dead material, we kept dead and dried flowers, since they had seeds and were still pretty in the bed. Even though autumn is in full swing, the vibrant colours of flowers were still shining! More allium bulbs were planted, another 100 or so.

  text: Since last week, rain has softened the ground. Taking the opportunity, we finished off digging over the parterre. The soil was much softer, and a clear increase in worms. In another parterre we worked to tidy up the irises, removing dead leaves and heads. We also planted another 100 allium bulbs.

  text: We dug up three different types of daylilies, keeping them for replanting, so that we could prepare a parterre for future planting. We carefully forked out the daylilies and kept them in bags. Afterwards we forked over the whole area. With the little rain over the summer the soil was hard and difficult to work with.

  text: The New Zealand flax have been doing very well. So well that they need to be chopped back to avoid slipping out over other plants. We chopped them back to the base, giving much more space to other surrounding plants. We also planted about 100 alliums around the Phlox.

  text: More watering! Since we have spent time addding new plants in the beds (14/07/2025) and changing plant pots (04/08/2025), we needed to ensure they were watered. This is important in the heat because the plants are more vulnerable while their roots become established.

  text: We spent today in the plant nursery. One of the plant cages was falling apart so this was dismantled first. We then repotted lots of the smaller plants into bigger pots. Fertiliser was added to the bottom of the pot, and soil filled in around the sides. Care was taken to fill the pots well and not leave air pockets. They were all given a good watering after. Once we had worked through a good amount we finished up, cleaning and organising the nursery. It looked good to see everything more organised and tidy.

  text: Some beds needed a little attention and smartening up. This involved some pruning to reshape the bushes, removal of dead leaves and tying back some plants to keep them overgrowing and shadowing other plants. We also had a few plants to go in and a substantial amount of watering to do around the whole park.

  text: We tackled the other side of the fragrant shrub border today. Like we did on the 23/06/2025, we cleaned and sharpened our tools before starting the pruning. We assessed the shrubs together and then got to work shearing, clipping and making the border pretty.

  text: A break from the heat and finally some much needed rain has hit. Along with the <a href="https://www.tcv.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCV</a> we got to work on a collection of tasks. Lots of paths, a car park and access maintenance needed to be done. This required the clearing of brambles, nettles, shrubs and some cutting back of trees that were encroaching on the paths. All the cuttings were repurposed to build organic hedges that bordered the paths and helped to protect saplings. We also used some of the tree cuttings to repair a fence that had fallen over.

  text: We have a small collection of plants that need a home. They were planted in the semi circle beds among other plants. Since the soil was fairly dry from all the heat, holes were dug, filled with water, then the plants were placed, covered in soil and then rewatered. The kitchen garden also needed attention. We spent time weeding the raised bed and removing dead leaves. All our weedings, except the bindweed, were added to the compost.

  text: It is hot and sunny! Despite an early start, it is already very hot and the plants need to be watered. Some raised beds are watered through a large passive water tank. Other beds and the sundial area need to be watered by hand. With the strong sun beaming down particular care was taken not to splash the plant leaves with water. The <i>Phlox paniculata</i> has flowered in a fantastic bright pink display.

  text: With the CREOS summer festival approaching in a few days the grassy field needs to be cut to allow people to sit comfortably. Using a strimmer, we started cutting the grass from the centre of the field. We hoped any disturbed animals would move outwards and not become trapped. The grass was not cut too short, and we left regions of well grown plants and a portion of the grass uncut, so as to not completely destroy the habitat.

  text: Today we pruned the fragrant shrub border, since none of the plants were flowering. Before starting, we had to clean all the pruning tools. The sap left on the tools can carry viruses and bacteria, which can infect plants by entering pruning cuts. We then assessed the plants and key aspects to consider for each pruning method, such as shearing, dead wood removal, pruning to the base, or just by a few nodes. All trimmings were collected and bagged, paths swept, to make the garden look fresh and well maintained.

  text: The heat has taken a toll on the plants and they are in need of watering. The Physic Garden, lower tier by the fountain and the raised beds by the café all had a good soaking, as well as other parts of the park. Care was taken to not splash the leaves and cause scorching, since the sun was out shining.

  text: Young hazelnut trees, some of which had been copiced, are surrounded by other trees and bramble. The plants covering the floor and bramble have grown extensively over the past year. This is potentially inhibiting the growth of the hazelnuts and wild flowers, which have been growing in the area last year. An area around the hazelnuts was therefore cleared, giving more space and light, hopefully allowing for the return of these wild flowers.
